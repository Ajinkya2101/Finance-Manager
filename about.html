       <div class="h3"><h2><u>What is an EMI?</u></h2></div>
       <p>EMI or equated monthly instalment is the fixed payment that is made by the borrower to the lender. EMIs pay back both the principal and the interest for each month, and the loan is fully repaid within a specified number of years. Here, the borrower could be you, and the lender could be the bank that has given you the loan.</p>
       <p>Take, for example, you have borrowed some money from your friend, but you are not able to return the entire amount in a single attempt. You both then decide that you would pay back a part of the amount every month, over a period at a specific interest rate, until you pay him back in full. This is nothing but Equated Monthly Instalment or EMI.</p>
       <p>This calculator provides a simple but quiet useful external feature where it let's you calculate EMI's (Equated Monthly Installments) of two different ROI'S. For example, suppose an user is confused about getting a loan and just cannot figure which bank to choose at what ROI. In a situation like this an external feature that let's compare 2 EMI'S for better closure and clarity. </p>
      </div>

       <div>

        <h4><u>Different Features and Variations:</u></h4>
        <p><li>Simple EMI calculator that also provides monthly schedule for the payments. </li>
        <li>Calculates EMI varying by the rate of interests and compares the monthly installments for user convenience.</li>
        <li>Bank specific calculations, in this all the user has to do is input the loan amount a the tenure of the loan and choose their bank.</li></p>

       </div>
       
       <div>
         <h3><u>How Does the EMI Calculator Work?</u></h3>
          <p>An EMI calculator is a handy tool that calculates the monthly amount payable to the lender, according to the following mathematical formula,</p>
          <u><h4>EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]</h4></u>
          <p>where, P, R, and N are the variables, which means the EMI value will change each time you change any of the three variables.</p>
          <p>‘P’ denotes the <u>‘Principal Amount’.</u> This is the original amount lent to you by the bank/lender. The loan amount will depend on your need and the purpose of the loan. The higher the loan amount, the higher will be the EMI that you pay for the loan.</p>
          <p>R represents the <u>‘Rate of Interest’.</u> This is the rate at which interest is charged on the principal loan amount. The interest rate will vary according to the type of loan taken and the lender (bank) from which you are taking the loan. The rate of interest has a direct bearing on your EMI amount; hence, it is important to compare interest rates across banks before opting for a loan.</p>
          <p>N indicates the number of years for which the loan has been taken. <u>This period is known as the 'tenure'.</u> The tenure of a loan refers to the total period given for the repayment of the loan. As the repayment is made every month.</p>
         </div>

      <div>
       <div class="h3"><h2><u>What is a Fixed Deposit?</u></h2></div>
       <p>As the name suggests, Fixed Deposit is an investment plan wherein you can deposit your lump sum money for a fixed period and earn interest. The rate of interest associated with the Fixed Deposit depends on the principal amount invested and investment tenure. So, on maturity, you will receive both the principal amount plus compound interest.</p>
       <p>Investors typically prefer to invest in Fixed deposits because it is safe and straightforward. Once you deposit your lump sum money, you keep earning a fixed interest amount. Returns on Fixed Deposits are unaffected by changes in the interest rate or market fluctuations.</p>
      </div>

   <div>
       <h3><u>How Does a Fixed Deposit Calculator Work?</u></h3>
       <p>The fixed deposit calculator for simple interest FD uses the following formula –</p>
       <h4><u><p>[M = P + (P x r x t/100)]</p></u></h4>
       <p>P is the <u>principal amount</u> that you deposit.</p>
       <p>r is the <u>rate of interest per annum</u>.</p>
       <p>t is the <u>tenure in years.</u></p>
      </div>

   <div>
       <div class="h3"><h2><u>What is a Profit and Loss Calculator?</u></h2></div>

   <div>
       <h3><u>How Does a Profit and Loss Calculator Work?</u></h3>

      </div>
       
   <div>
       <div class="h3"><h2><u>What is Simple interest?</u></h2></div>
       <p>The rate at which you borrow or lend money is called the simple interest. If a borrower takes money from a lender, an extra amount of money is paid back to the lender. The borrowed money which is given for a specific period is called the principal. The extra amount which is paid back to the lender for using the money is called the interest.</p>
      </div>

       <div class="h3"><h2><u>What is Compound interest?</u></h2></div>
       <p>Compound interest is the interest on interest. In simple terms, the addition of interest to the principal sum of the loan or deposit is called compound interest. If you have an investment account, you earn money on your interest. The interest that you earn is reinvested, instead of paying it out. If you are repaying a loan that charges compound interest, you are paying interest on the interest. If you earn compound interest on your investment, it grows without any further deposits. You may increase the deposits to raise the efficacy of the compound interest.</p>
      </div>

   <div>
       <div class="h3"><h2><u>What is a Compound interest calculator?</u></h2></div>
       <p>A compound interest calculator is a simulation, that shows how investments grow with time. You need three parts to calculate the compound interest that is the principal amount, interest rate, and time for which the money is invested. The compound interest calculator consists of a formula box, where you enter the compounding frequency, principal amount, rate of interest, and the period. The calculator will show you the future value of your investments.</p>
